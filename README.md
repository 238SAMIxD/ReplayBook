# ROFL-Player

This application is very simple, it works like this:

- Launch the program and direct it to the League of Legends.exe file. Something like Riot Games\League of Legends\RADS\solutions\lol_game_client_sln\releases\0.0.1.179\deploy\League of Legends.exe
- That's it, you can now choose a replay to run. The application also remembers where the League of Legends executable is next time you open it.
- If you tell Windows to open .rofl files with this application, it will automatically start playing if the League of Legends.exe is valid!

This is the very first version of the application, so bugs and weird behavior should be expected. Please let me know!

**Why does this exist?**

"You can just copy the replay into the folder containing League of Legends.exe and drag the replay onto the executable! What's the point of this?"

I'm lazy.
