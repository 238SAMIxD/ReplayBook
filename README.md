# ROFL-Player
A simple application that handles opening League of Legends replay files. By setting file association in Windows, this application will allow you to double click view replays.

This application allows users to view replays outside of the client.

Are you tired of how replays disappear from your match history as you play more games? Are you tried for digging through a nest of directories just to play a replay? Then you should use ROFL-Player!
